# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple and interactive command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. This game allows two players to take turns, placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 board. The first player to align three marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins the game. It's a fun way to practice Python basics like loops, functions, and conditionals.
